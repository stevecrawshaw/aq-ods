## Pollutants {background-image="plots/weca_ppt_image_sized_3.png"}
- Nitrogen oxides (NOx) - a group of gases that includes NO~2~ and nitric oxide (NO) - complex atmospheric chemistry creates.. 
- Nitrogen dioxide (NO~2~) - an acidic gas that irritates the lungs
- Particulate matter (PM~10~ and PM~2.5~) - tiny particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs
- Ozone (O~3~) - a reactive gas that can cause respiratory problems
- Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) - important ozone precursors

## Sources of Air Pollution {background-image="plots/weca_ppt_image_sized_3.png"}

## Sources and Exposure (NOx) {background-image="plots/weca_ppt_image_sized_3.png"}

::: {.notes}
Roadside exposure to NO2 is much greater than a purely emissions based analysis would suggest.

## Sources and Exposure (PM) {background-image="plots/weca_ppt_image_sized_3.png"}

- Transport accounts for 21% of PM~2.5~ and 18% of PM~10~
- 20% of PM~2.5~ emissions from domestic solid fuel
  - i.e. where people live
  - almost all discretionary emissions
  - 36% increase in PM from this source 2009 - 2020
  
## Indoor pollution {background-image="plots/weca_ppt_image_sized_3.png"}

- Indoor pollution is significant but less regulated than outdoor
- Cooking (gas) - NO~2~
- Heating (solid fuel) - PM~2.5~
- Off - gassing (furniture, carpets, paint) - VOCs
- Transport (and other) emissions ingress from outside
